I am currently an Assistant Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Bentley University. Prior to joining Bentley, I received my PhD in statistics at Harvard University, where I was a member of the CARES Lab led by Luke Miratrix and affiliate of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science.

My research is eclectic and I find myself constantly drawn to applied statistics problems in fields ranging from education to political science to pharmaceutical research. But underneath it all, I'm interested in the development and application of methods for causal inference with complex data, including text data, randomized experiments complicated by issues such as non-compliance, and observational studies with time-varying treatments.
